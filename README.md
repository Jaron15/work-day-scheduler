# Work Day Scheduler 
This is a work day scheduler that uses moment.js to work with the date and time to help you organize your work day. Simply clicking into a time block allows you to enter in a task or tasks you would like to complete in that time period and then you can save these tasks to the page by clicking the save button to the right. 

# Features  
* When you initially open the page at the top you will see that the date is set to the current date

 * You will then notice the list of rows for each hour with the current hour being highlighted in red, the past hours in grey and the upcoming hours in green

* If you click on any of the boxes you will be able to fill them in with whatever tasks you want and then save them to the page with the blue save button located on the right of the row
